# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_CUSTOMER_CREDIT_CARD_DATA

I worked on a group project to create an Excel dashboard using customer credit card data. The project began with a thorough understanding and cleaning of the raw dataset, which included various customer attributes such as income, education, gender, family status, housing type, occupation, age, and more.

After data cleaning, we identified key performance indicators (KPIs) to analyze consumer behavior and spending patterns. These KPIs included factors such as education level, occupation, family size, housing type, age, and work experience. We transformed the raw data into structured input data suitable for analysis.

Using Excel, we created various tables, pivot tables, and pivot charts to visualize the data and derive meaningful insights. These visualizations were then compiled into a comprehensive and interactive dashboard. To enhance navigation, hyperlinks were incorporated within the dashboard to redirect users to the relevant sections or sheets.

Overall, the dashboard provided a clear and insightful view into customer demographics and spending behavior, aiding in better understanding and decision-making.
